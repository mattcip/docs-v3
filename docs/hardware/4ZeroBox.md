# 4ZeroBox

The 4ZeroBox is a modular hardware electronic unit that simplifies the development of Industrial IoT applications allowing rapid integration with sensors, actuators, and Cloud services.

4ZeroBox mounts a powerful ESP32 Microcontroller by Espressif Systems (240MHz, 16Mb Flash, 512KB SRAM) and provides many onboard features like: a DIN-rail mountable case with industrial grade sensor channels, support for Wi-fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, LoRa, CAN, RS485, RS232, SD Card, JTAG, I2C, SPI; last but not least, there are 2 on-board MikroBUS sockets to extend the 4ZeroBox with hundreds of MikroElektronika click boards (see “MikroBus Slots” section).

## Flash Layout

The internal flash of the ESP32 module is organized in a single flash area with pages of 4096 bytes each. The flash starts at address 0x00000, but many areas are reserved for Esp32 IDF SDK and Zerynth OS. There exist two different layouts based on the presence of BLE support.

| Start address | Size  | Content                 |
|---------------|-------|-------------------------|
| 0x0000A000    | 20Kb  | Esp32 NVS area          |
| 0x0000F000    | 4Kb   | Esp32 PHY data          |
| 0x00010000    | 2Mb   | Zerynth VM              |
| 0x00210000    | 1Mb   | Zerynth Bytecode        |
| 0x00310000    | 3Mb   | Zerynth Park (FOTA)     |
| 0x00610000    | 3Mb   | Zerynth Scratch (FOTA)  |
| 0x00910000    | 64Kb  | Zerynth Otalog          |
| 0x00920000    | 7040Kb| File System             |

## Power

Power to the 4ZeroBox is supplied via the on-board USB Micro B connector or directly via the “24V-GND” screws (9-36 Vdc compatible). The power source is selected automatically. Zerynth 4ZeroBox has also a JST Li-Po battery connector (3.7V).
